So, are you a reddit fan? Love to wave around your hammer of judgement to up or downvote the content that everybody adds to the evergrowing list? Or are you the explorer, that always finds the newest and coolest sites on ~~the web~~ hyperboria? And always the one to share what you find?

Checkout [uppit](http://uppit.us/). The hyperboria reddit clone. 

It might be a bit quiet at times, but as soon as some critical user mass gets active it can easily flourish as its clearnet brother.
