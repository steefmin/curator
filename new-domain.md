This blog is now also available on [curator.steefmin.xyz](http://curator.steefmin.xyz), or on hyperboria via [curator.h.steefmin.xyz](http://curator.h.steefmin.xyz).
I've been looking if I should buy a domain name for a while now. After being busy past weeks with new web development and a great sale on .xyz domains, I just got one. 

*.steefmin.xyz is available from all over the clearnet. *.h.steefmin.xyz is the hyperboria 'mirror'. I put mirror between apostrophes because not everything is mirrored entirely the same. Some are clearnet only, some are hyperboria only. Check [nodeinfo.json](/nodeinfo.json) for all the hyperboria services.
