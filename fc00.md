In a previous post I wrote about [distributed networks](post/a-distributed-world). But how does such a network look like? 

People are very focussed on visualizing things. As sight is probably our most used sense. Especially for abstract ideas this helps us to understand and wrap our minds around it. Introducing [fc00.org](https://www.fc00.org) and it's [mirror](http://[fc53:dcc5:e89d:9082:4097:6622:5e82:c654]) on the biggest cjdns network [Hyperboria](http://hyperboria.net). 

Look around, click around and enjoy the view.
