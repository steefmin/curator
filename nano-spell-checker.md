Now I'll be doing a lot of more typing on my server and English is not my native language, a spell checker for my favorite command line editor `nano` will be a good idea. 

The incredible power and wisdom of Google returned me a solution. 

Steps:

	sudo apt-get install spell

and done... I could have thought of that myself. 

Just hit `^T` in any nano file and it will check for English spelling. 

Ok, that might not have been the most difficult, but will help me a lot in future articles.
