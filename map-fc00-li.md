Last post I wrote about how facinating it is to be able to look at the entire network of nodes connected to hyperboria. 
To do that, I suggested to look at [fc00.org](http://fc00.org). This is viewable on the clearnet. But if you are also connected to hyperboria, [map.fc00.li](http://map.fc00.li/) will give an even better view. 

This is due to how the map is generated. fc00.org gets it's information about nodes and links from user sent reports via a python script. The new map.fc00.li gets this from a new supernode system that builds an entire view of the network to help routing in a future cjdns supernode/subnode setup.
